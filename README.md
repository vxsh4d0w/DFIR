# DFIR Sharing Repo
The aim of this repository is to share as many info as I can to support Dfir experts to face any kind of incident and to speed up their analysis.
I tried to build something during my daily operations not only to make every analysis easier but also to help people to learn some shortcuts to extract, parse and analyze any possible evidence.
